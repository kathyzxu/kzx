    <p class="hidden">
        thinking about how the past year has been the longest year of my life. i feel somewhat similar to the way i did last summer, but thinking about all that i went through in the fall... like wow. i mean at least i came out of the struggle a way stronger, capable, and adaptive person!! i think i want to start a blog again, cataloguing my journal entries digitally rather than scattered throughout a bunch of half-finished journals. but it's also nice to just jot down my thoughts wherever. it's easier when there's no stakes to it. anyway. here are some things that I've accomplished in the past year, just to quantify my progress (still trying to minimize lists though) because some things feel so natural to me now, like it's always been this way, but it hasn't. and honestly, some of these transformations are pretty recent too but they still feel normal and natural to me. life is very dynamic i guess.
        <br><br>- sorted out what i want to study in college and genuinely am interested in it. dropped wanting to concentrate in anthropology/sociology and letting myself choose the classes i want instead.
        <br><br>- got over the imposter syndrome at the beginning of freshman year when i felt pressured to join a bunch of clubs i probably wouldn't have loved
        <br><br>- on a similar note, realized that i just function better when i treat school as education, and it's kind of hard for me to find community within the school setting. i'd rather just leave campus, and i should honor that instead of constantly seeking out spaces that i theoretically fit into but just feel alienated from. i have community in the friendships that I've formed here, but i'd rather just nurture those friendships and explore other spaces in new York. like who cares if i'm in a school publication. 
        <br><br>- got more comfortable reaching out to new people and cultivating healthy, "secure" friendships as Julia put it
        <br><br>- identified friendships where i didn't feel fully comfortable and supported and let those fizzle out
        <br><br>- went through my first and second relationships
        <br><br>- lived by myself for the first time
        <br><br>- participated in and wrote about encampments --- understanding the role of the university, the institution, and the student body in this world
        <br><br>- went to so many shitty shows (maybe going out just isn't that great)
        <br><br>- made new friends outside of college (really want to develop those friendships as a goal this summer)
        <br><br>- noticed and honored patterns in myself that occurred throughout high school but didn't become apparent to me until college --> independence, loving time by myself, liking group settings but preferring one-on-one time, escaping school to do shit myself
        <br><br>- (got kissed) by jude
        <br><br>- made up with joelle
        <br><br>- traveled to Europe for the first time, want to go again
        <br><br>- tried molly and ketamine and poppers for the first time
        <br><br>- realized that i just really hate weed

        9:35 pm
        <br><br>decided i want to stay up tonight and think instead of trying to distract myself by doomscrolling or looking 
        through old photos or seeking out some shitty show that i don't want to go to. 
        <br><br>i always get depressed when i'm in the apartment alone, and i guess i felt the same way in may when i was 
        back home. i also feel that icky feeling creeping up on me a lot when i'm hanging out with people, and i can't 
        really justify or explain it. when i went to gaia's the other day, i felt that. i don't know why. 
        <br><br>i have a lot of things that i need to work through just mentally. i tell myself i'm so reflective, but really 
        i'm just rethinking the same thoughts over and over again and that's what clouds my brain and takes up so much mental
        space, but it's not like i'm going anywhere with them.
        <br><br>why do i have an eating disorder? and when did it emerge (it's blurry) and what catalyzed it and how can i 
        stop it? because at this point, it is so deeply wired into my brain to avoid certain foods or to minimize portions 
        or to stop myself the SECOND i feel the tiniest bit full. it's like second nature.
        <br><br>i think part of it was my 'relationship' with james, and part of it was my 'friendship' with erin, part of 
        it internet consumption, etc etc etc. it's like the more i'm valued or reminded about my beauty --- like i know i'm 
        beautiful and i'm glad that isn't something i'm insecure about --- the more i NEED to cling to and sustain it, 
        because when i lose it (which i inevitably will; at least youthful beauty which is what men lavish at), i lose part 
        of my value. and i have to find value elsewhere. why do i buy almondmilk when i like oat milk better? why do i 
        overthink everything i eat, why do i drink so much water with my meals, why do i chew so much before i swallow? i 
        don't know my own body, and i need to relearn that. i need to relearn the foods i used to love, and not overthink 
        it. it goes so deep. i'm only nineteen, but i feel my beauty fleeting. it's only self-destructive, because who am i
        being beautiful for? the men who i don't have the emotional availability or even attraction for? the gawkers on the
        street that make me feel unsafe? the women who compare my body to theirs? 
        <br><br>i like feeling confident, but i can do that in a way that doesn't come out of a place of self-loathing. i 
        guess that isn't even confidence at that point.
        <br><br>i feel a lot of guilt about the way i treated Isaiah near the end of our relationship. i know that looking 
        back, i can tell myself that i should've done a lot of things different even though i physically COULD NOT when i 
        was in it, but there are many points in our relationship where i should have said something or drawn a line or even 
        broke things off, because i think what happened was i dug myself deeper and deeper into a commitment hole, even 
        though i was aware that i wasn't ready for it. and instead of confronting him even towards the end, i fucking TREATED 
        HIM WORSE SO THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IT COMING like me being a people pleaser really just ended up hurting him 
        more. and that's SO fucked up. he might not be that upset, and i hope he isn't, and maybe i'm villainizing myself a 
        bit more and my actions weren't as evil as i thought they were, but i know that my thoughts were. omg. i was so mean 
        to him in my mind. it was like a fucking storm in my brain. once we were broken up and i saw him through the lens of 
        a friend, i regained so much SO MUCH respect for him and treated him with a kindness that i would any other friend. 
        why was i so mean to him when we were more than that? did i care for him less?
        <br><br>i don't know. i think we were always meant to be friends. i don't think i was ready for a relationship (i KNOW i wasn't), but also i don't know if it's just cause i wasn't ready for a relationship with HIM. 
        <br><br>i don't get why i have this weird destructive hyperfixation with soren still. i still keep telling people about him. i resent him because everyone's so obsessed with him, but honestly i do the same thing. i don't know. i never liked him, so i don't know why i thought about him so much and let him like destroy me from the inside out.
        <br><br>i think that deep down, i want to think that i'm better than everyone and so i look for ways to justify that. when i struggled with making friends first semester, i kept on coming up with excuses even though i was frankly just falling behind socially. when other people are into hookup culture etc., i feel shitty about myself because i'm unable to meet someone and make a move. i compare myself. way too much. i treat people differently based on how they present themselves. i'm judgmental, and a hater, and multiple friends have told me that jokingly. that's not good. i need to see people as people. 
        <br><br>i don't know why im always thinking about making art or starting to read or starting to listen to more new music and then never doing it.
        <br><br>i feel lonely, but i'm not sure how to remedy that. i think i just need to go through what i need to go through.
        <br><br>i'm so addicted to my phone.
        <br><br>i lie a lot.
        <br><br>i try so hard to document everything. everything. i'm really neurotic about it, and i think it gets in the way of my ability to enjoy things. i don't know who i'm performing for.
