        To be honest, I'm just bitter all the time. I don't think I'm around the right people. I don't think there are the “right people,” at least not in high school. Everything is glamorized. Real life is dull. 
        <br><br>I don't remember what it was like to “be” before quarantine. During quarantine, too. It's like my life is a line that somehow got me where I am today, but some asshole has to erase that line and leave me stranded in the middle of a page. What the fuck. I'm so empty.
        <br><br>Nothing satisfies me. I feel so on edge. So unwhole. Can't do shit. Constant headache. Constant stress.

        Summer will be better cause he won't be here anymore, but not much better. 
        <br><br>A change of seasons won't help. My sadness comes from much deeper. I need a radical restructuring of my brain folds. 
        <br><br>I don't crave a coming-of-age summer. I crave an “I'm twelve years old and my primary worries are making it to practice on time and figuring out where mom should pick us up from Westgate” summer. 
        <br><br>Nothing but a reversal of time will make me happy now. I've started tallying my friends, hangouts, boys, calories…

        Junior year went by insanely fast. Tooooo fast. This summer will be different, I think.
        <br><br>I grow up so fast but so slow. I'm 17. I remember listening to Taylor Swift's Fifteen when I turned 16. I remember feeling old when I turned 13. I'm leaving in a year. Do I care?

        Today, on the ride to my physician's office, I made the decision that I'm going to distance myself from my mother.

        Typing this entry out of a shitty hotel room in Xi'an. I feel like I haven't written anything real in years. 
        <br><br>Feeling stuck. I've been hopping from city to city in China for around two weeks now. Before leaving for this trip, I confidently announced to all my friends how depressed I would feel spending a month with my parents dragging me around a country I didn't want to be in. Leaving the beach, the parties, the pretty boyfriend, the sneaking around and sneaking back in too late--it all felt too perfect. I was so unwilling to give it up, even just for a few weeks.
        <br><br>It's a lot better than I imagined. I haven't gotten into any real fights with my parents, but I think that's mainly because it's been me and my dad for the majority of my time here. He's on the receptive end of my parents' relationship. My mother's the inflammatory one. 
        <br><br>Seeing my extended family meant a lot more to me than I thought it would. It felt like returning home when I stepped into my grandparents' apartment, though I'd probably spent no more than 3 months time here my entire life. I could see how each one of my family members have aged since I last saw them--four years of fine lines and weight loss and gain and my grandmother has dementia and forgets how old I am now. It hurt and it healed me. Jia jia, eighteen, all grown up. Lots of pressure for the baby of the family. 
        <br><br>I caught up with my cousin, who I don't remember interracting with since I was a toddler. She's twenty-four now, and we have a lot more in common than I imagined. I told her about James. She was happy for me.
        <br><br>But--nine days until I go back. I can't help but count down the time. Nine days until I can sleep in my own bed, make a big breakfast for myself, drive around in my 2000 pound vehicle just to buy groceries, fuck in the backseat of my boyfriends' Jeep, tell my sister I'm sleeping over at Emma's house when I'm driving down to LA, borrow an occasional cigarette or two from Alex's boyfriend, get lost in the crowd of attractive well-dressed nicotine-addicted college kids, stumble onto my rooftop on shrooms and cry about how I'm legally an adult and there's nothing I can do about it. 
        <br><br>Every sixty days or so I enter into a new headspace and entirely forget what my life was like before. March feels like so long ago. I'm going to college soon. I'm not in love with Jude anymore. I'm sober and I finally feel hot again. I think I'm growing out of my friends. I wonder how Joelle's doing from time to time. 
        <br><br>On the bus ride back from Laguna, Claire told me feelings are weird right now. I don't think things will stop feeling that way for a while.

        I spent my Christmas drinking my dad's Heinekens and being a passenger princess in Fiona's white BMW. Forgot how good driving around is. We went up nine and listened to Lorde. I missed that girl. We don't really show our affection to each other—physically or verbally—but I know it's there from the things that we do for each other. She paid for a plane ticket just to visit me in New York. We spent Christmas with one another. We got Wingstop and drank a bit and she offered me a cigarette and just drove us around. We made cookies. The simplest things. It was beautiful.
        <br><br>I spoke to Joelle for the first time in ten months today. Eight months, if we count that time we were getting ready for the rave and she looked at me like i was a stranger. She said that it doesn't feel like it's been a year since we've talked. I agree. 
        <br><br>She's dating a boy now. He's nineteen and rides a motorcycle and has tattoos and loves molly. I'm glad she's happy, and I hope she's healthier now. She told me she ghosted me because she was afraid she liked me more than I liked her. That sucks because it wasn't true. She really hurt me. But I'm over it. I just don't know if we can be friends again, but it's good to be cordial.
        <br><br>We talked about boys a lot. It's eerie how similar we are. The way we speak—our cadences—it's like we're the same person. I've grown, and I've changed, but I still speak like her, and I think like her, and I explain things with the same articulation and structure as her. She really left an impression on me—like planting a seed in my mind that grew in parallel with her. We are connected, and we have always been connected, even though we were apart for so long.
        <br><br>It's strange. I feel like my growth has been severely stunted in the past few months, which is ironic considering I was launched into a new city and theoretically should be forced to grow? I just haven't formed many new connections with people, and I don't feel like an adult. It's like being in college made me revert to my squeamish, insecure self that I thought I'd grown out of in eighth grade. Feel like I'm running in circles, and I'm becoming more and more unsure of myself by the day.
        <br><br>I think I'm too critical of myself, and that's what's holding me back. I enumerate my flaws, and I compare myself to others without acknowledging areas where I naturally excel. See how I'm criticizing how I'm too critical of myself? Yeah. I need to let go a bit. 
        <br><br>I don't know how I feel about the men I involve myself with. Same thing with my friends. I don't think I've been in love or anything close to it. I don't think I put any meaning into sex. It just happens, and I just go along with it. God, I need to grow a spine.
        <br><br>It's okay. I just hope I don't feel so neutral going into my twenties. I want to feel like I've made progress. I feel so little. Self-loathing really is the main thing holding me back.
        <br><br>Another thing I've noticed is how the spaces I'm in reflect and influence my behavior. Being back home makes me revert to the person I was before I left; hell, before summer or senior year even started. When I'm at school, I'm in a totally different headspace. It's like switching between realities and time frames. Time is totally not a continuum—I swear it's parallel lines—one at school that freezes when I come home and resumes when I return to campus, and one at home that freezes when I'm in New York. 
        <br><br>I put too much pressure on myself and my growth. I wonder how long I'll keep striving for a version of myself, some pre-prescribed happy and perfect person, that doesn't exist. I'm really just always in my head, huh? I've always been this way, and I don't think I realized that until now. I've always just thought this has been okay, but I think I need to see a therapist.

        12:48 am.
        <br><br>I think I like the woman that I'm becoming. I think a lot, about myself and how I am with the people around me, and that makes my mind rich and beautiful.
        <br><br>I always find myself looping back into really destructive cycles of stress--needing to figure out a plan and a future where I'm always busy and doing a million things--and then I realize that none of it means anything. Like I'm enough just by being here and being a good friend to people.
        <br><br>I'm trying to keep TikTok deleted. I deleted and reinstalled Instagram this morning. I'm going to delete it again.
        <br><br>I don't get my sister. She's bitter and reclusive and difficult to talk to. Same with my parents I guess, but to a lesser degree. I'm going to try to call them more next semester.
        <br><br>Break has been pretty good for my mental health. I think I'm getting a little too comfortable at home though, so I'm excited to go back. I'm going to try new things and make new friends and let loose a bit more. I'm going to be great, I promise.
        <br><br>I saw James today. Fiona pierced my helix about a week ago, and she's going to do two other piercings on Wednesday. I'm doing shrooms with Jude tomorrow, and I'm hanging out with Caroline for the first time in five years (or ever, kinda) on Thursday. I'm doing a photoshoot with Anika too. Trying to relearn photoshop.
        <br><br>The last time I saw Jude, he held and kissed the back of my hand before he left my car, and I felt the urge to pull him in and bite him on the cheek and tell him how much I loved him when he was still with Amelie, and how things will always be complicated between us no matter who we're seeing or how platonic we act with one another. I don't know. There's a tender spot in my heart for him, like the brown, meally bits of an apple when it starts to go bad. I wonder if he feels it too. I just know that if he wanted to sleep with me, I'd probably let him. Which is why it's good we're strictly friends. If we were to open the door to anything else, things would get infinitely messier, and I don't think either of us would have the capacity to clean them up.
        <br><br>My emotions towards other people come and go. I don't feel super super close or vulnerable to anyone at the moment--friends or hookups--and the thought of having a boyfriend or girlfriend is making me feel a little claustrophobic. I've never been in a serious, committed, long term relationship. I'm just like a man. 
        <br><br>I hope my dad doesn't get lonely in the month that everyone else is gone. My mom will be back to keep him company soon. I see him picking up on hobbies. I really like the new speaker system he got. He watches tv while drinking a beer and eating sunflower seeds each night. My parents are getting old, and I don't even know them that well. I need them to know that I'm busy, but not too busy to talk to them.
        <br><br>I don't know what I'm going to do about my sister. Maybe I'll live with her for a few days this summer in LA so we'd be forced to talk.

        No paper to write this on but I worked really hard studying for my math test and am really proud of myself for going through the material so many times to fully understand it. Even though the bulk of it wasn't even tested and I made some stupid mistakes on the test (basically the amount of work I put into studying didn't feel reflected on the actual test), I'm happy that I found so much beauty in the studying process. I've never understood the theory through and through like this before. I got offered a spot in CSUREMM over the summer, and I accepted it. I'm currently browsing apartments to share with Isaiah in Williamsburg. I get paid to learn and I'm ecstatic.
