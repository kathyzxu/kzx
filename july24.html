    <h3 class ="expandable">> July 1</h3>

        Moved (again) into an apartment complex in East Williamsburg a four minute walk from the L. I'm single and my commute 
        to work is a lot shorter now. I'm staying with this skinny eclectic 50-something-year-old record store owner named 
        Jay, who survives off ginger mango smoothies and a massive post-punk record collection that he likes to break out in 
        the mornings. It's getting almost unbearably hot in New York and bedrotting has become ultra inticing, but at least 
        I've been out and making new friends. And the city is still beautiful.
    </p>    
    <h3 class="expandable">> July 5</h3>
    <p class="hidden">
        This past week has deadass been the longest week of my life...
        <br><br>FINALLY got my fake and went out to a bunch of bars in the Bushwick area. Being surrounded by people in their mid-20s--it's interesting to see how people transition into adulthood. Semi-adjusted baristas, mini-influencers, "photographers," "creatives"... Everybody is beautiful and broken and a bit aimless. 
        <br><br>Yesteray we ran around in the rain downtown after the fireworks had subsided. Noel and I had taken a gram and a half of shrooms--not enough to fully trip, but enough to make the city a bit prettier than it usually is. I'm pretty sure the combination of the weather and the psychedelics was what gave me a cough the next day, but it was worth it. Everything was quiet and beautiful. Grace #2 was having her moment, prancing around the West Village and not saying a word, and I loved it.      
        <br><br>I feel like EVERYTHING has happened to me in the past year. Literally even in the span of the past two weeks, so much has changed. What's terrifying is that I'm already feeling a bit sick of all the new things I've experienced. I've gone out so much and met and laughed with so many new people, but there's always a tinge of loneliness undercutting every interaction.        
        <br><br>I don't know what will fix that loneliness. I don't want a relationship, I don't need more friends. I miss the people at home, but when I go back it's not the same. Plus we're never all in the same place at the same time anymore. I still feel like a kid but I can see my body changing. When I look in the mirror, I see more of a woman than a girl. 
        <br><br>I don't know if I'm in love with Jude, but god I want to see them. I also don't know why Soren's been on my mind lately. It's so confusing. For some reason I want to catch up with him in a way that isn't totally strictly platonic. It's fucked up but seeing everyone obsess over him has made me so resent him but in a way where now I (emphasis on I) need to "conquer" him so I can prove to myself that he's just a dude. But again, him being on my mind like that just makes me like everyone else. It's like a need a male to occupy that portion of my consciousness that I thought was superfluous to my everyday existence but I guess isn't! 
        <br><br>I got over Isaiah too fast. I know, shocker, coming from someone who literally ended every romantic situation she has ever been involved in and never pursues. I still feel bad though. Crusehs and flirting is only fun when it stays in that fantasyland. Anything more is just soooo mentally taxing and unnecessary. I really honestly wonder if I will ever be ready (or, god forbid, WANT) a relationship. Especially with a man. 
        <br><br>Anyway. I'm bad at keepign up with my friends but thankfully they are all coming to the city next year anyway so that will make it a bit easier. 
        <br><br>I also don't know why I need to constantly be making new freinds. I guess it's good. I'm actually not super sure if it is LOL like am I just trying to desperately escape aloneness???
        <br><br>I can't tell if I miss high school or not. The thought of going through another three years of college and STILL having to deal with life after is a little brutal. I find myself always manufacturing changes--or like injecting conditions that would necessitate change and growth--in my life so that I don't get bored. Like jam-packing experience into my life, always trying to max things out. But at a certain point, the amount of experiences that are within the human range of emotion runs out. And what do I do with my brain when that happens?
        <br><br>Oh my lord. That was such a brain dump. I'm starting to feel a bit better, and I want to get my computer and book so I don't wnat to walk all the way home and run the risk of rotting again. Maybe I'll turn this journal into website, who knows.
    </p>

        I don't know if I'm just delirious from my illness or if it's hormones or if I'm genuinely going crazy but whyyyyy am I thinking about Soren so much. And I guess yearning for an idyllic flirty transient romance in general. Like this morning in my delirium I dreamt about living in a cabin with a beautiful long-haired boy in Washington or Northern Oregon or something. I woke up and he was cracking eggs into a stainless steel pan. 
        <br><br>Whatever. I wish I had the energy to get up and do anything at all. I haven't gone to work in a week, and it's driving me insane.
